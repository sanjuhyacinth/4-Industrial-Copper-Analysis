# 4-Industrial-Copper-Analysis
This project on industrial copper analysis requires us to create 2 models of regression (to predict selling price on user inputs) and classification (to classify if a potential lead is Success or Failure). We are using python's ML modules for our model building.

# Project Overview
## Domain:
Manufacturing sector

## Skills take-away:
Python scripting, Data Preprocessing, EDA, Streamlit

## Modules in Python:
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* Pickle
* Streamlit
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* XGBoost

## Project Process:
### Data Processing:
* Loaded the copper CSV into a DataFrame.
* Cleaned and filled missing values, addressed outliers, and adjusted data types.
* Analyzed data distribution and treated skewness

### Feature Engineering:
* Assessed feature correlation to identify potential multicollinearity
* Encoded categorical variables to use in prediction
  
### Data Modelling:
* Built a regression model for selling price prediction.
* Built a classification model for status prediction.
* Pickled the trained models for deployment.

## Streamlit App:
* In the 'Home' section of our project, We have information relating to **Copper** - all information on what it is, How is copper used and it's graphical growth in India. Also some more information materials on copper has been provided as YouTube material.

* The 'About' section of the app gives information on the project, the domain of it and an overview of the steps that were done.
  
* The 'Predictive Analysis' section of the app is the most important part where we display the predictions of price and status of potential customer conversion. We have used regression and classification models respectively for this, and have created a user-interactive way where based on the user inputs we get the result.
  
* Finally, in the 'Inference' section, we have explained the nuances of the data and model used with accuracies and what not about the predictions. Both the models have been interpretted here.
